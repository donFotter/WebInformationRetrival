# Web Information Retrival - Team ESA Final Project
Project for the Web Information Retrival class, Master Degree in Computer Engineering @ La Sapienza, Universit√† di Roma<br>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

Our project follows a precise topic: is possible to categorized any kind document (after the needed operations) using the Wikipedia's Corpus? This topic was widely discussed by Peter Schonofen in its paper "Identifying document topics using the Wikipedia category network", which is dated 2006. The aim of our project is to show if those results are still valid after more than twelve years and an exponential growth of Wikipedia's Corpus. Here we post the code developed for reproduce the experiments under our new conditions, a pdf file that explain our work and our results and the Power Point presentation that we use to expose the project to our professors.<br>
<h3>File provided:</h3>

We have uploaded all the code written to reproduce the experiments and both the two corpora used. The 20 Newsgroup one is compressed under the corpus.rar file, while the Wikipedia's random corpus is built at runtime. The datasetReader and datasetReaderOpt are the two Python files that run the experiments (one without optimization and one optimized). <br>
The two datasetReaders produce the results in two files, output.txt and outputOpt.txt <br>
The PaperESA is our paper with all the result included while our PowerPoint presentation is the FinalProject.pptx file.

Language and library used: Python 3.6, NumPy, SciKit <br>
