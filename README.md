# Web Information Retrival - Team ESA Final Project
Project for the Web Information Retrival class, Master Degree in Computer Engineering @ La Sapienza, Universit√† di Roma<br>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

Our project follows a precise topic: is possible to categorized any kind document (after the needed operations) using the Wikipedia's Corpus? This topic was widely discussed by Peter Schonofen in its paper "Identifying document topics using the Wikipedia category network", which is dated 2006. The aim of our project is to show if those results are still valid after more than twelve years and an exponential growth of Wikipedia's Corpus. Here we post the code developed for reproduce the experiments under our new conditions, a pdf file that explain our work and our results and the Power Point presentation that we use to expose the project to our professors.
